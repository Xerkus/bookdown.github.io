<p>Bookdown needs your help! As a new project, we are eager to bring in contributors who are interested in DocBook-like documentation, but without the heavy toolchain and XML of DocBook itself.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, you can clone or fork the <a href="https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown">core library repository</a> from Github. We plan to use the <a href="https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown/issues">Issues</a> as the main means of community communication. <a href="https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown/pulls">Pull Requests</a> especially are appreciated, particularly for items on <a href="https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Bookdown#todo">the Todo list</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a designer, you can already tell that we are design-challenged. It would be awesome if we could provide a good-looking stylesheet out-of-the-box for the <a href="https://github.com/bookdown/Bookdown.Project">Bookdown project skeleton</a>.  In addition, we are interested in figuring out a way to provide Composer-deliverable themes for Bookdown, so that other design-challenged developers can make their work look good.</p>
