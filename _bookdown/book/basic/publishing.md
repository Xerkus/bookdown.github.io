# Publishing

To publish the generated content, use `git add` and `git commit` on the various Markdown, JSON, and HTML files we have created, then push them to their origin. If the origin is Github Pages, then Github will automatically serve them for you. Alternatively, you can copy the files from the `"target"` directory wherever you like, or do with them whatever you wish.
