# Introduction

## What Is Bookdown?

Bookdown generates [DocBook](http://docbook.org)-like HTML output using Markdown and JSON files instead of XML markup.

Bookdown is especially well-suited for publishing project documentation to GitHub Pages.

Features include:

- Multi-page hierarchical output

- Automatic table-of-contents generation as index pages at each hierarchy level

- Custom index-page titles via JSON configuration

- Automatic numbering of page headings

- Loading of remote content files via HTTP

- Templated output for theming

- Overridable page processing, especially for rendering

Bookdown can be used as a static site generator, or as a way to publish static pages as a subdirectory in an existing site.
