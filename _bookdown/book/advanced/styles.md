# Adding CSS Files

By default, Bookdown does not come with any CSS files. The HTML output is functional, but not particularly stylish.

To add CSS styles:

1. Place `.css` files of your choosing somewhere the `"target"` directory.

2. Modify the `{$REPO}/_bookdown/templates/head.php` file to add `<link ... />` tags for the `.css` files. Note that these should be linked relative to the `"target"` directory, not the Bookdown origin files.

3. Regenerate the HTML and browse the results.

Let's try an example.

First, create a `css/` subdirectory in the `"target"` directory. By default, the `"target"` is the `{$REPO}` root.

    cd {$REPO}
    mkdir css

Next, copy the following stylesheet to the `css/` subdirectory as `style.css`:

    body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
    }

Then edit the `head.php` override template to add a link to the stylesheet. The file will look something like this:

    <head>
        <title><?php echo $this->page->getTitle(); ?></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/style.css" />
    </head>

(Note that the link HREF is in relation to the `"target"` directory.)

Finally, regenerate the HTML files and browse through them. You should see that the stylesheet is now being honored on every page.

> N.b.: Because the `css/style.css` file is static and not generated by Bookdown, you can edit it and re-browse the pages, and see the style changes immediately.
